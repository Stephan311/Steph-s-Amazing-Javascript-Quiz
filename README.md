# Steph-s-Amazing-Javascript-Quiz

In this program, my goal was to create a quiz that tests basic JS knowledge that a programmer should know. With 5 questions, each having a score of 20 given to them for a correct answer, the score is set out of 100. After running into various challenges, I was able to find a method that worked. This quiz also stores user scores and can return the score using the user's name.Below is a screenshot and revelant links.
